Rainbows
Thought I'd never know
Warmth
All the pain will be gone
And the saints will respond
Tell me, where did they go?
And where should we go?
When the puppet couldn't find its master, it
spoke–
I still remain
And I'm still one and the same
Though my love now goes by a different name
My heart stays unchanged
We're not wishing for a brand new world
The lost can still be redeemed
It has always been a beautiful world
We just weren't looking
Why do we feel so rushed?
Why do we feel so rushed?
Why don't we feel enough?
We're already enough
Let us bloom for us
I still remain
And I'm still one and the same
Though my love now goes by a different name
My heart stays unchanged
